## Movie Trailer Website
This website shows my favourite movies and plays their trailers. The project is part of Udacity Full Stack Web Developer.

Aim of this project is to learn how to write an application using object-oriented Python programming as well as how to serve HTML using a web server and how web servers receive requests, execute a block of code, and generate a response.

## Project Requirements / Features

* Writing server side code to store a list of movie titles, box art, poster images, and movie trailer URLs.
* The data will be expressed on the web page and allow users to watch the trailers.
* Project works the way it's supposed to: movies and their poster images are displayed on the web page, there is a trailer link and it opens from the Python file error free.
* Code is organised and professional.
* Comments are used when needed.
